Hello everyone! In this folder, you will find tutorials and projects in which I used the Google Earth Engine platform.
The tutorials are hosted in the "Getting started" folder and are mainly intended for those who never worked with GEE, as there are very basic code. Those were the tutorials I followed when first started working with GEE. 
More advanced projects are presented by specific names, as follows:
- Endmembers: GEE tutorial for calculating endmembers from landsat images.
- Getting Started: Simple code to process satellite images.
  - dowload_landsat
  - calculate-spectral-indices-and-download-sentinel-data
  - dowload_sentinel
  - NPP_download
- Kriging: Obtain interpolated values at unsampled locations by using kriging. The semivariogram parameters are not calculated here.
- LST: Simple code to calculate Land Surface Temperature from Landsat thermal bands.
- NDVI: Calculate the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index by different way using a single image or over a collection of images.
- TERRACLIMATE: Download climatic variables
- soilgrids: Donwload soil maps from the SoilGrids platform
- removeCloudsLandsat: Use a mask to exclude areas with clouds:
- S2A_TOA_to_BOA: Atmospheric correction of S2A TOA image to BOA.
- terrain_analysis: calculate terrain attributes from a digital elevation image
